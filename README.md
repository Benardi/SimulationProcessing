# Simulation Processing
Processing of simulation results as outputted by the simulation application `Arena`. This project aims to conform the simulation results to the known standard `CSV` and to do so taking advantage of mechanisms such as buffering. Also, it's one of its objectives to skim all unnecesary and meaningless data from the simulation results.
